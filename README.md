# Converting-GeoJSON-to-XML

## Description
This Grrovy code reads the extracted ocean glider observation metadata saved as GeoJSON and maps it to OGC O&M Observation model.


All the xml files generated by this code are confomat with OGC Sensor Web Enablemet standards. The xml implementation is done according to the OGC Observation and Measurement XML implementation version 2.0 and OGC SensorML Model and XML Encoding Standard version 2.0.0

This script is organised as the following:

  1- The first part extracts the variable names form the Argo project Parameter list. This results in a list of all the variables that could be mapped to the Nerc Vocabulary server.

  2- The second part creates the om:OM_Observation xml metadata file.

  3- The third part creates the om:observedProperty which links the varaibles in the glider mission's file to the Nerc vocabulary server.

  4- The fourth part creates the InsertSensor xml request file.



  ## How to use
  The glider metadata could be extracted though the following code
    https://github.com/FadiMoubayed/Extracting-metadata-from-glider-NetCDF-files

  The Argo project Parameter list could be downloaded from the following link
  http://www.argodatamgt.org/content/download/30910/209488/file/argo-parameters-list-core-and-b_20210211.xlsx

  For the ease of use, the Excel file should be manualy opened and the variable names and their links to the Nerc vocabulary server should be saved and a csv file.

  The scv file in addition to the metadata GeoJSON files should be copied to the resouces folder in the relative path.

  The output variable should indicate the ouptut folder where the xml files will be saved.

  Since this is only a propotype and the app is not hosted yet, xml elements such as sos:offering, om:observedProperty have links to files hosted on Github.
